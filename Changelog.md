Initial releases of the package were still based upon use as a library for 
personal use. As such, the package was not well documented and the structure
underwent some significant changes. The following is a summary of the changes
that have been made to the package beginning with the first PyPi release. 

Beginning with Version 0.3.1 the field analysis package was introduced, which 
may lead to broader interest from potential users. As such, I began to improve
documentation and testing with that release. 

Backwards compatibility has not been uniformly maintained by releases due to 
the primary impact being on my individual use. Beginning with version 0.4.0, 
the package will adopt a consistent approach and will strive to maintain 
backwards compatibility for releases within the same minor version (0.X.X).
